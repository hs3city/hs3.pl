Hackerspace Trójmiasto (HS3) is a community founded with the support of the CODE:ME foundation, related to education in the IT industry.

HS3 was established in 2016, as a complement to the non-profit activities of the CODE:ME Foundation to support the process of thoughtful teaching not only during training and not only in the area of programming, but also outside of them, among graduates and people with technical interests. The combination of CODE:ME activity, willingness to develop, and many technological events allowed us to initiate the Hackerspace Trójmiasto community. Thanks to joint activities and mutual benefits, the foundation can continue to pursue its statutory goals while supporting HS3, and the community gains a permanent partner ensuring stability.

With many experiences related to the functioning of hackerspaces, we believe that this formula combining the community and a functioning legal entity works best for us. The Foundation ensures the stability and continuity of the community also in difficult situations. As a legal entity, it takes on several administrative activities related to, among others, accounting or legal care. These are important aspects not only because of their importance related to the personal responsibility of managers but also because of the costs.

Regardless of the fact that the Foundation is the founder of Hackerspace Tricity, we create partner relations, which is covered by mutual benefits.
