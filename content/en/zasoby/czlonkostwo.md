Hackerspace Trójmiasto is a non-profit organisation, supported by membership fees.
We use the money to pay for the rent of the space, purchase the {{% link ref=/zasoby/chciejlista %}}necessary equipment{{% /link %}}, create {{% link ref=/zasoby/stypendia-hs3 %}}HS3 scholarships{{% /link %}} and organize {{% link ref=/wydarzenia %}}interesting events{{% /link %}}.

By supporting Hackerspace Trójmiasto, you help to democratize knowledge and promote skills in arts and crafts.
You support the work of dozens of people who change their local communities for the better.
You support the engine of these changes.
Together we improve society.

As a contributor, you gain access to our physical space and the equipment there. You can work on your own projects or join the existing ones. 
You can support Hackerspace Trójmiasto for as little as 16 PLN per month.
If you donate at least 128 PLN per month, you get your own keys and the ability to use the space day and night (but remember: we do not sleep in the space!)
