Hackerspace Trójmiasto Picnics are held every last Friday of the month.

They are open to both member and non-members, and they are a great opportunity for those interested in making / hacking / programming to come meet us.

They are free of charge, but you are expected to bring your own "everything".

They're held at our Hackerspace (either inside the building, or in case of nice weather, in the park next door).

Sometimes there are additional attractions during picnics, such as [pumpkin laser cutting](https://www.youtu.be/fwM8jjUy9WY), jam sessions (bring your instrument if you have one!) or [screen printing on T-shirts](https://youtu.be/jEnqVexmKrI).

Always there is lots of space for enjoyment, chats and socializing.
